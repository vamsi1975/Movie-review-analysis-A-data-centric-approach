sentiment analysis on movie reviews
As the film industry produces an increasing number of movies annually, viewers often turn to movie reviews to help decide what to watch. These reviews are crucial as they provide insights into the quality of a film according to viewer experiences. By using sentiment analysis, a technique in data science, we can extract the emotional tone from these reviews, determining whether opinions are generally positive, negative, or neutral.

â€ƒFor this project, we applied sentiment analysis to movie reviews to understand the overall sentiment expressed by the reviewers. This involves examining how specific words in the reviews relate to each other to predict whether the feedback is positive or negative. The goal is to help movie producers understand audience preferences and assist potential viewers in making informed decisions about which movies to watch based on their interests.
